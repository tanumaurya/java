// Question 1
// Joe was reading an interesting novel when all of a sudden, his 5 year old son came to him and started asking few questions about functions.
// He tried making him understand various functions, but his son didn’t get find it interesting.
// Then he created his function Absent number function A(S)
// According to this function, there is always the smallest positive integer number in a sequence that is not available.
// In simple words,if you sort the given sequence ,then the smallest integer number (other than 0) which is not present in the sequence is the Absent number.
// Consider a sequence S= [1, 2, 3], then B(S)=4.
// The minimum value greater than 0 which is not present here is in the sequence is 4.
// Now his son found it interesting ,so Joe extended this logic to sub-sequence.
// If there is a given sequence S, you have to find the Absent Number for each sub-sequence and then sum it up.
// if the answer is large, print the result modulo, 109 +7.
// Let say there exist a sequence with N = 3, and sequence S = [1, 2, 1]
// Below are the various sub-sequences of it,
// Basically it will be 2N:
// [ ] : B([ ]) = 1
// [1] : B([1]) = 2
// [2] : B([2]) = 1
// [1] : B([1]) = 2
// [1, 2] : B([1, 2]) = 3
// [2, 1] : B([2, 1]) = 3
// [1, 1] : B([1, 1]) = 2
// [1, 2, 1] : B([1, 2, 1]) = 3
// Total sum of all B(S) = 1+2+1+2+3+3+2+3 = 17.
// Hence the answer is 17.
// Example 1:
// Input:
// 2 -> input Integer ,N
// 1 1 -> input Integer,S
// Output:
// 7 -> Output
// Explanation:
// In the above scenario below are the various sub-sequence and respective function of it:
// [ ] : B(l) = 1
// [1]: B([1])= 2
// [1]: B([1]) = 2
// [1,1]: B([1,1]) = 2
// Total sum of all B(S) = 1+2+2+2 = 7 Hence the answer is 7.
// Example 2:
// Input:
// 3 -> Input integer, N
// 1 2 1 -> Input integer, S
// Output:
// 17->Output
// Explanation:
// In the above scenario below are the various sub-sequences and respective function of it.
// [ ] : B([ ]) = 1
// [1] : B([1]) = 2
// [2] : B([2]) =1
// [1] : B([1]) = 2
// [1, 2] : B([1, 2]) = 3
// [2, 1] : B([2, 1]) = 3
// [1, 1] : B([1, 1]) = 2
// [1, 2, 1] : B([1, 2, 1]) = 3
// Total sum of all B(S) = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 17.
//     Hence the answer is 17.
